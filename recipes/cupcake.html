        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is an easy vanilla cupcake recipe. I am kidding</p>
        
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Sugar - 3/4 Cup</li>
            <li>Softened Butter - 2/3 cup</li>
            <li>Large Eggs - 3x</li>
            <li>Flour - 1 1/2 cups</li>
            <li>Vanilla Extract - 1 teaspoon</li>

        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 12-cup muffin tin or line cups with paper liners.</li>
            
            <li>Beat sugar and butter together in a large bowl with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Add eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition.</li>

            <li>Beat in vanilla extract. Stir in flour just until mixed; spoon batter into the prepared muffin cups, filling each 3/4 full.</li>

            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the tops spring back when lightly pressed, 18 to 20 minutes. Cool in the tin briefly before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>

        </ol>
